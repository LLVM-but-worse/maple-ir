     * Find the Lowest Common Ancestor of a directed graph.
     *
     * <p>Find the LCA, defined as <i>Let G = (V, E) be a DAG, and let x, y ∈ V
     * . Let G x,y be the subgraph of G induced by the set of all common
     * ancestors of x and y. Define SLCA (x, y) to be the set of out-degree 0
     * nodes (leafs) in G x,y . The lowest common ancestors of x and y are the
     * elements of SLCA (x, y). This naive algorithm simply starts at a and b,
     * recursing upwards to the root(s) of the DAG. Wherever the recursion paths
     * cross we have found our LCA.</i> from
     * http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~bender/pub/JALG05-daglca.pdf. The algorithm:
     *
     * <pre>
     * 1. Start at each of nodes you wish to find the lca for (a and b)
     * 2. Create sets aSet containing a, and bSet containing b
     * 3. If either set intersects with the union of the other sets previous values (i.e. the set of notes visited) then
     *    that intersection is LCA. if there are multiple intersections then the earliest one added is the LCA.
     * 4. Repeat from step 3, with aSet now the parents of everything in aSet, and bSet the parents of everything in bSet
     * 5. If there are no more parents to descend to then there is no LCA
     * </pre>
     *
     * The rationale for this working is that in each iteration of the loop we
     * are considering all the ancestors of a that have a path of length n back
     * to a, where n is the depth of the recursion. The same is true of b.
     *
     * <p>We start by checking if a == b.<br>
     * if not we look to see if there is any intersection between parents(a) and
     * (parents(b) union b) (and the same with a and b swapped)<br>
     * if not we look to see if there is any intersection between
     * parents(parents(a)) and (parents(parents(b)) union parents(b) union b)
     * (and the same with a and b swapped)<br>
     * continues
     *
     * <p>This means at the end of recursion n, we know if there is an LCA that
     * has a path of &lt;=n to a and b. Of course we may have to wait longer if
     * the path to a is of length n, but the path to b&gt;n. at the first loop
     * we have a path of 0 length from the nodes we are considering as LCA to
     * their respective children which we wish to find the LCA for.
